# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our projects and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing for mistakes
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, or sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing acceptable behavior and will take appropriate action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the maintainers at
**[opensource@artificerinnovations.com](mailto:opensource@artificerinnovations.com)**.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
All maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

2. **Warning** – A warning with consequences for continued behavior.
